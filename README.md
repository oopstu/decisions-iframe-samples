### Decisions CORS and Service API Sample React App
This is a simple sample application meant to accelerate debugging and troubleshooting with any iFrame or service call work you are doing to an external application.

This app started with just an iFrame Decisions Native sign on strategy and can be improved or amended as needs arise.

# To Use:
1. Clone the repo (duh.)
2. (If you don't have it:) Install node.js (google, download from main site and install it.)
3. run 'npm install' 
4. run 'npm start'

If you have any trouble or issues, contact the last product developer you saw playing ping pong and get their help.

Hugs.
